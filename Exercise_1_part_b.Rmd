 report the mean and variance of the sample in
line in the text. In general, do not just dump the R code and plots in the HTML
document; break your exercises

1. samples 100 values from a log-normal distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25)
```{r setup}
set.seed(12)
random <- rlnorm(20, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```

2. create a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale
```{r}
hist(log(random))
```

The mean is `r mean(random)` and the variance is `rvar(random)`.
