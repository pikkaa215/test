# Part B

1. samples 100 values from a log-normal distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25)
```{r setup}
set.seed(12)
random <- rlnorm(20, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```

2. hisogram 

(1) on the original data
```{r}
hist(random, main = 'Histogram on raw data')
```

The mean is `r round(mean(random),2)` and the variance is `r round(var(random),2)`.

(2) On the log-scale
```{r}
hist(log(random), main = "Histogram on log-scale")
```
